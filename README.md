This project is a full-featured Twitter-like REST API backend built with Spring Boot. The backend has advanced functionality for managing users, tweets, and comments. Users may register for an account, log in, and get their user information via specific APIs.
Users may make new tweets, update old ones, delete tweets, and view information for individual tweets or all tweets accessible. Similarly, the API provides complete comment management, allowing users to post comments to tweets, modify or delete them, and receive information about individual or all comments associated with a tweet persisted utilizing an in-memory H2 database, making it simple to set up and run.
The project is developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework, leveraging Spring Data JPA for data persistence and an H2 in-memory database for storage. Gradle is used for project management and dependency resolution.
